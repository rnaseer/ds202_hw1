**Name**: Joseph Strobel

**Github username**: strobelight6

**Rabsa's most recent commit** added "Homework 1 RMarkDown files". The **commit id** is: d3a85eea47b019ec64d0bc46521fa6e2ba9a8a4d

There is an error when I try to knit Rabsa's .Rmd file because the image used has an absolute path. 

One error I encountered was uploading my local git repo to the Github repo. Github did not show me the instructions to upload an existing repo so I just cloned the repo to my machine and added the files, then made and pushed a commit.
